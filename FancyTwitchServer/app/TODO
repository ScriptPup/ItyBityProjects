# Bug Fixes Needed:

## UI Bugs

1. Deletes don't always update for some reason
2. Updates don't always update for some reason

# Additional Features needed:

## Redemptions
- Add link to twitch: when "Manage Here?" is set to "Yes", then when the server recieved the add request it should check if a redemption of that name already exists. If so, check if it's owned by this application; if so, so then modify it. If there is one and it's not owned by this app then fail with an error. If there's no command, create it and register it as owned.

## "Hidden" variable sets

Maybe something like `{!var=something}`

The idea is you can do something like

```
name: !hearmeout something is off here...
command: The last time we heard you out, you said "{hearMeOut}". {!hearMeOut=@message}
expected result: The last time we heard you out, you said "If this works I'll eat my hat"
```

## Implement timeout settings so you users can't spam things insecently 
    - User timeout
    - Global timeout

## Add custom command extension

Allow for a custom command action to be called instead of going through the parser. I imagine it would look something like this:

- Use PreMiddleware for this
- Return "BREAK" from any PreMiddleware to stop execution after the middleware

```
name: !fanart
command: ~cycleArt
expected: performs custom action that cycles the fan-art displayed by a custom page
expected: Either replies with an output, or doesn't reply at all
```
