# Bug Fixes Needed:

## UI Bugs

1. Deletes don't always update for some reason
2. Updates don't always update for some reason

# Additional Features needed:

## "Hidden" variable sets

Maybe something like `{!var=something}`

The idea is you can do something like

```
name: !hearmeout something is off here...
command: The last time we heard you out, you said "{hearMeOut}". {!hearMeOut=@message}
expected result: The last time we heard you out, you said "If this works I'll eat my hat"
```

## Implement user level checks so you can choose which commands are/aren't allowed

## Implement timeout settings so you users can't spam things insecently 
    - User timeout
    - Global timeout
