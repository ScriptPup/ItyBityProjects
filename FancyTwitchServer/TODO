# Bug Fixes Needed:

$() evaluations should not be broken by nested ( or ).

@1 @2, etc not working correctly for twitch message replacement

# Additional Features needed:

## "Hidden" variable sets

Maybe something like `{!var=something}`

The idea is you can do something like

```
name: !hearmeout something is off here...
command: The last time we heard you out, you said "{hearMeOut}". {!hearMeOut=@message}
expected result: The last time we heard you out, you said "If this works I'll eat my hat"
```
